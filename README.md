# homebridge-http-garagedoorcontroller (v2)
An HTTP based Garage Door/Light plugin for [HomeBridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)

![Demo](https://github.com/washcroft/HttpGarageDoorController/raw/master/reference/demo.gif "Demo")

# About
This HomeBridge (Apple HomeKit) plugin exposes a garage door accessory and optional garage light, allowing control of your garage door and/or garage light via standard HTTP requests, from within the Apple ecosystem. Since security is important here, both API Key header and **[OAuth 1.0a](https://oauth.net/core/1.0a/) signing/authentication** is supported.

I added an Arduino based WiFi-enabled controller onto my existing garage door operator, the Arduino ran an HTTP server on the network listening for these HTTP requests from HomeBridge.

The Arduino controller toggles GPIO outputs to operate the garage door (using either two separate open/close relays, or more commonly cycling the same one) and also a third output to control the garage light (another relay).

The Arduino controller also uses GPIO inputs to report the state of the garage door (two inputs from separate open/closed reed switches) and also a third input to allow the garage light to be controlled via another source (i.e. the garage door operator itself).

>>>>Trying to change this to implement AUTO CLOSE DOOR. TESTING NEEDED!!!

### Arduino Project
My Arduino project which accompanies this HomeBridge plugin can be found at [HttpGarageDoorController](https://github.com/washcroft/HttpGarageDoorController), however this plugin can work for other implementations too.


# Configuration

HomeBridge configuration sample:

```
  "accessories": [
    {
      "accessory": "HttpGarageDoorController",
      "name": "Garage Door",
      "lightName": "Garage Light",
      
      "doorOperationSeconds": 0,
      "simulateDoorOpenSeconds": 10,
      "doorAutoClose": true,
      
      "httpHost": "garagedoorcontroller.local",
      "httpPort": 80,
      "httpSsl": false,
      "httpStatusPollMilliseconds": 4000,
      "httpRequestTimeoutMilliseconds": 10000,
      
      "httpHeaderName": "X-API-Key",
      "httpHeaderValue": "MyAPIKey",
      
      "oauthAuthentication": true,
      "oauthSignatureMethod": "HMAC-SHA256",
      "oauthConsumerKey": "MyOAuthConsumerKey",
      "oauthConsumerSecret": "MyOAuthConsumerSecret",
      "oauthToken": "MyOAuthToken",
      "oauthTokenSecret": "MyOAuthTokenSecret",
      
      "apiConfig":
      {
        "apiType": "HttpGarageDoorController"
      }
    }
  ],
```

For other implementations, the **apiConfig** block should be completed as follows:

### Json API

```
      "apiConfig":
      {
        "apiType": "Json",
        "doorSuccessField": "success",
        
        "doorOpenMethod": "PUT",
        "doorOpenUrl": "/controller/door/open",
        
        "doorCloseMethod": "PUT",
        "doorCloseUrl": "/controller/door/close",
        
        "doorStateMethod": "GET",
        "doorStateUrl": "/controller/door/status",
        "doorStateField": "door-state",
        
        "lightSuccessField": "success",
        
        "lightOnMethod": "PUT",
        "lightOnUrl": "/controller/light/on",
        
        "lightOffMethod": "PUT",
        "lightOffUrl": "/controller/light/off",
        
        "lightStateMethod": "GET",
        "lightStateUrl": "/controller/light/status",
        "lightStateField": "light-state"
      }
```

### Generic / Plain API

```
      "apiConfig":
      {
        "apiType": "Generic",
        
        "doorOpenMethod": "GET",
        "doorOpenUrl": "/controller/door/open",
        "doorOpenSuccessContent": "OK",
        
        "doorCloseMethod": "GET",
        "doorCloseUrl": "/controller/door/close",
        "doorCloseSuccessContent": "OK",
        
        "doorStateMethod": "GET",
        "doorStateUrl":"/controller/door/status",
        
        "lightOnMethod": "GET",
        "lightOnUrl":"/controller/light/on",
        "lightOnSuccessContent": "OK",
        
        "lightOffMethod": "GET",
        "lightOffUrl":"/controller/light/off",
        "lightOffSuccessContent": "OK",
